      Tens of millions of people played the family board game Journey Through Europe published by Ravensburger. The board is a map of Europe with various major cities marked, for example, Athens, Amsterdam and London. The players are given a home city from which they will begin and are then dealt a number of cards with various other cities on them. They must plan a route between each of the cities in their hand of cards. On each turn they throw a die and move between the cities. The winner is the first player to visit each of their cities and then return to their home base.

What could be better? Well how about if we implement it as a computer game. Yes, that’s right, forget the cumbersome board, we’re going to make the computer version.


1.1	Purpose

The purpose of this document is to precisely specify how our Journey Through Europe game should look and play. The intended audience for this document is all the members of the development team, from the game designers to the artists, to the software engineers and even salespeople who will ultimately interface with the customers. This document serves as an agreement among all parties and a reference for how the game should ultimately be constructed. Upon completing the reading of this document, one should clearly visualize how the game application will look and operate as well as understand the game rules.


1.2 Scope

Here at Debugging Enterprises, we are looking forward to a long future as a casual game development company. This starts with Journey Through Europe, but by no means ends there. We hope to release future map-related titles as well like Journey Through Long Island, Journey Through United States, Journey Through Stony Brook University, Journey Through New York State, and of course, Journey Through Manhattan. Since we’re lining up a whole series of casual games, we want to be sure to make good design decisions that result in reusable components. As such, a framework (or set of frameworks), should be designed and constructed to be used to make Journey Through Europe as well as the other similar map games. Note that the point of Journey Through Europe is simply to entertain. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_Through_Europe">JTE Website</a>
